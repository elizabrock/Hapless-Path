??Streaming algorithms \cite{barton:streaming} sound really interesting.  However, given the slightly-stateful, mostly-synchronous nature of the project's XPath processing I'm not sure that streaming algorithms work in this context.  

??I'm certain that the streaming algorithms that work with backward axes wouldn't work with the "sub-expression at a time" approach that I plan on taking.  However, it would be very interesting to use forward-axis only streaming processing.
