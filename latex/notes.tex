"checks whether or not an XPath query Q conforms to the structure, semantics, data type and occurrence constraints in a given XML schema definition S by evaluating Q on S rather than the instance documents of S. If Q does not conform to the constraints of S, Q cannot be evaluated completely on S, and thus Q is unsatisfiable."\cite{groppe:filtering}


\subsection{XPath Axes}
child - covered by mini-DOM
parent - covered by mini-DOM
descendant - covered by range labeling + indexing
ancestor - covered by range labeling +indexing
followingsibling  - covered by range labeling in conjunction with mini-DOM (e.g. all children of your parent whose range is greater than your own)
precedingsibling - covered by range labeling in conjunction with mini-DOM (e.g. all children of your parent whose range is lesser than your own)
following - range labeling (all nodes whose range does not intersect with yours and is greater than your own)
preceding - range labeling (all nodes whose range does not intersect with yours and is lesser than your own)
